# PlaceLab

PlaceLab provides you with a simple interface for accessing, processing,
analysing and exporting your organisation's spatial and aspatial data.

Recipes are invoked using eg:

    app/PlaceLab.py --recipe=recipes/example_01.txt

Where, `recipies/example_01.txt` is just a text file with a list of tasks
to run (ie. tasks found in the tasksDir).
