# Pozi Connect: Documentation

## About Pozi Connect

Pozi Connect is a powerful data extraction and processing application that draws on data from multiple spatial and non-spatial sources to generate derived datasets and map layers.

It generates map layers from corporate databases (spatial and non-spatial), performs spatial data analysis, converts between data formats (Esri SHP, MapInfo TAB, DXF, KML, CSV, XLS, GeoJSON and others), loads data into spatial databases (SQL Server 2008, PostGIS, Oracle Spatial), and generally automates many of the tasks that GIS Administrators find themselves doing on a regular basis.
