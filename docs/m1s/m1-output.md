# Pozi Connect: M1 Output

### History File

The history file maintains every record generated by Pozi Connect, whether you've submitted them or not.

It is not imperative that you submit every M1. If a discrepancy remains unresolved, Pozi Connect will just regenerate the same edit every time, so it doesn't matter if you don't submit an M1.

Pozi Connect does have the ability to remember if a particular edit has been generated before, but it only uses this to display the date in the last column of the M1. It will always include all potential edits on the M1, even if they have been generated before.
