PlaceLab uses the following software libraries:

 * agw
 * wxPython
 * iniparse
 * wxFormBuilder
 * RealPyOdbc 

********************************************************************************
** agw (Latest Revision: 30 Nov 2009, 16.00 GMT)                              **

The page http://www.wxpython.org/docs/api/wx.lib.agw-module.html states:

    Copyright: Andrea Gavana License: Same as the version of wxPython 
    you are using it with.

********************************************************************************
** wxPython (2.8)                                                             **
********************************************************************************
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WxPython#License:

    Being a wrapper, wxPython uses the same free software licence used by 
    wxWidgets (wxWindows License)â€”which is approved by Free Software 
    Foundation and Open Source Initiative.

********************************************************************************
** wxWidgets (2.8)                                                            **
********************************************************************************
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WxWidgets#License:

    wxWidgets is distributed under a custom made licence, similar to the GNU 
    Lesser General Public License, with an exception stating that derived works
    in binary form may be distributed on the user's own terms. This licence is 
    a free software licence, making wxWidgets free software.

or, as stated here http://www.wxwidgets.org/about/newlicen.htm:

    The wxWindows Licence is essentially the L-GPL (Library General Public 
    Licence), with an exception stating that derived works in binary form may 
    be distributed on the user's own terms. This is a solution that satisfies 
    those who wish to produce GPL'ed software using wxWidgets, and also those 
    producing proprietary software.

********************************************************************************
** wxFormBuilder (3.1.x)                                                      **
********************************************************************************
We use wxFormBuilder to build the GUI. The application itself is GPLv2, however
we do not distribute the application.
Whether or not the output of it is GPL is a bit less clear. One of the authors
states on this page: http://forum.wxformbuilder.org/index.php?topic=313.0:
    
    I don't think that the output of wxFB "constitutes 
    a work based on" wxFB, and therefore, we claim no copyright on it. It is 
    the work of the user of the program, they can decide what to do with it.

** iniparse (0.4)                                                             **
