Version 1.2
https://github.com/groundtruth/PlaceLab/tree/v1.2
(Sun 15, 2010)

 * Recipes are invoked using eg:
   app/PlaceLab.py --recipe=recipes/example_01.txt
   Where, recipies/example_01.txt is just a text file with a list of tasks to run
   (ie. tasks found in the tasksDir)

 * File and Dir task inputs are now a text field with a "..." button
